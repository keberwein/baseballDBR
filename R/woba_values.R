#' @title Return wOBA values per season
#' @description Get wOBA values for each year in your database. This calculation requires all fields of
#' the Pitching, Fielding and Batting tables from the Lahman package, or a comparable data set. The function uses
#' a version of Tom Tango's wOBA formula by default, but can also return Fangraphs wOBA values.
#' @param BattingTable A full batting table from the \code{Lahman} package or the Chadwick Bureau GitHub repository.
#' Any subsetting or removal of players will affect your results. All players for each year are recomended.
#' @param PitchingTable A full pitching table from the \code{Lahman} package or the Chadwick Bureau GitHub repository.
#' Any subsetting or removal of players will affect your results. All players for each year are recomended.
#' @param FieldingTable A full batting table from the \code{Lahman} package or the Chadwick Bureau GitHub repository.
#' Any subsetting or removal of players will affect your results. All players for each year are recomended.
#' @param Sep.Leagues If TRUE, this will split the calculation and return unique wOBA values for the various leagues. This can be
#' helpful in handling Designated Hitters and National League pitchers. It also isolates the park factors to their respective leagues.
#' @param Fangraphs if TRUE the function will return the Fangraphs wOBA values. By default the function uses a method adapted from
#' Tom Tango. These values are often very close to Fangraphs, but are not the same due to Fangraphs using a different algorithum.
#' This can not be used in conjunction with the \code{Sep.Leagues} argument because Fangraphs does not separate FIP constants by league.
